# Saving-Notebook
Inspired by Browserpad, which I love and use all the time. If you don't know what that is, it's a notepad... in your browser. The cool thing about it, though, is that even if you close the Browserpad window/tab, when you reopen it- whatever you type is saved. This is based off of that idea, but instead of auto-saves, you control whether it saves text.
